Congratulations to Zhou Yingming for successfully applying the undergraduate program of Beijing Natural Science Foundation.

<!--more-->

As an important part of the Beijing Natural Science Foundation, the project aims to support the basic scientific research of outstanding undergraduates and cultivate young academic talents who are expected to enter the forefront of world science and technology.
In October 2024, Yingming Zhou of AIM Lab was successfully approved by the Beijing Natural Science Foundation Project with the title of "Research on Process Automation Modeling Technology for Multimodal Data" and the instructor was Leilei Lin

AIM Lab has always attached great importance to the cultivation of students' scientific research ability, focusing on enhancing students' professional quality and innovation ability through practical projects. The successful application of the undergraduate project is not only an affirmation of the laboratory's scientific research training system, but also an injection of new impetus for the laboratory's subsequent improvement of teaching quality and accumulation of academic achievements. In the future, the laboratory will continue to rely on high-quality platforms such as the Beijing Nature Foundation to stimulate students' scientific research interest and improve their innovation ability, and contribute to the construction of high-quality basic research talents.

AIM Lab will continue to support students in their exploration of scientific research, encourage more undergraduates to actively participate in the application of scientific research projects, promote academic progress and innovation with practical actions, and help the college achieve new leaps in talent training and scientific research development.
